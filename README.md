The "X O Gaming" project is a web-based implementation of the classic game. It is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The web interface features a 3x3 grid of clickable squares, where players take turns marking X or O symbols. A prominent title at the top indicates the current player's turn, displaying either "X turn" or "O turn."

The JavaScript code handles the game logic and interaction. It facilitates the seamless switch between X and O symbols upon clicking the squares. The code also checks for winning conditions based on possible patterns in the game, highlighting the winning combination and displaying the victorious player's symbol.
